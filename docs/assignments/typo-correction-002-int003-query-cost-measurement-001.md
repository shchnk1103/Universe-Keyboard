## Current Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle | **Active** — P0 complete; P1 review pending, P2 environment freeze pending |
| Current phase | Round-3 Architecture review is **Pass with conditions** for all seven claims. P1 AUTH is consumed at `2026-09-27T18:01:36+08:00` on the exact reviewed baseline before source edits; implementation and focused verification are now authorized within its unchanged allowlist. P2 remains gated on exact installed payload and Run-manifest freeze |
| Authority | [P0 AUTH](../authorizations/AUTH-TYPO-CORRECTION-002-INT003-QUERY-COST-MEASUREMENT-PLAN-001.md) Consumed; [P1 AUTH](../authorizations/AUTH-TYPO-CORRECTION-002-INT003-QUERY-COST-P1-INSTRUMENTATION-001.md) Consumed for the reviewed P1 source scope; [P2 AUTH](../authorizations/AUTH-TYPO-CORRECTION-002-INT003-QUERY-COST-P2-SIM-CAPTURE-001.md) Active/unconsumed, execution gated on exact payload and Run freeze |
| Publication / M-02 | [PR #179](https://github.com/shchnk1103/Universe-Keyboard/pull/179) merged `9838c092672dae60c63b34e4d9be6dffafc3869f`; [PR #180](https://github.com/shchnk1103/Universe-Keyboard/pull/180) merged `c3cc229619604131d6358bbc85f74e81f2874dc6` with the single non-recursive closeout receipt. [PR #181](https://github.com/shchnk1103/Universe-Keyboard/pull/181) merged `2b9b15ee2d1d903b3a948109b2c2217535bd5248`, adding the separate P1/P2 authority records; its M-02 receipt is prepared at [post-merge state sync](../evidence/typo-correction-002-int003-query-cost-p1-p2-authorization-post-merge-state-sync-2026-09-27.md) |
| Non-claims | No Swift/ObjC change, new Capture, Release-like result, numeric budget, independent Quality conclusion, Product/QA-001 Gate, parent Close, TestFlight/Release or `RimeRuntimeProvenance` restore |
| Next | Implement and verify P1 within the reviewed source allowlist; then freeze the exact installed payload and Run manifest and consume P2 before any Simulator operation. Parent remains [Active](typo-correction-002.md) |

## Assignment authority and inputs

- **Assignment Authority / Product Approver:** Human Product Owner / Product Lead. **Decision source:** Human 2026-09-26 Asia/Shanghai instruction authorizing a new Assignment/AUTH and KOS continuation after PR #178.
- **Required P0 inputs (historical baseline):** [query-cost assessment](../evidence/typo-correction-002-int003-query-cost-assessment-2026-09-26.md), [Product residual](../product-decisions/TYPO-CORRECTION-002-INT003-STALE-CANCEL-PRODUCT-CAPTURE-001-PRODUCT-RESIDUAL.md), [`PERFORMANCE_BASELINE`](../PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md), [`TYPO_CORRECTION`](../TYPO_CORRECTION.md), designated Simulator and physical-device [evidence profile](../kos/universe-keyboard-human-operated-evidence-profile.md), source at GitHub `main` `7b0025a10a3079731628e63a7ffd587af57608d6` when P0 assessment began.
- **P0 scope:** Source/evidence reading, measurement method and privacy boundary design, this Assignment/AUTH, parent and status navigation mirrors, docs-only validation, one draft PR. No executable instrumentation or device operation.
- **Future stage dependency:** P1 instrument/verify and P2 capture can enter Ready only after a distinct Product Assignment decision/AUTH binds exact source, allowed files, reviewer, environment executor, run manifest and evidence question. P2 physical evidence also needs the Human-operated profile's readiness review and one-round budget. A Product performance budget or residual disposition is a further decision after evidence.

## Entry, exit and stop

| Stage | Entry | Exit / handoff |
|---|---|---|
| P0 plan (complete) | Clean isolated worktree at verified GitHub main; Human authorized new Assignment/AUTH; prior raw/evidence identity already bound | [Plan](../plans/typo-correction-002-int003-query-cost-measurement-001.md), P0 AUTH and one M-02 closeout are published and merged |
| P1 instrumentation (consumed; active) | P1 AUTH consumed at `2026-09-27T18:01:36+08:00` after independent round-3 **Pass with conditions**, bound to baseline `1160ac6f…` and the 28-file manifest `a98a722b…`. Keep the reviewed typed Field and allowed paths; implement the review's Stage, bucket, readiness, timing, schema, ownership and censoring conditions. Strict Swift-format lint before any Swift commit/push | Content-free instrumentation with focused correctness evidence and bounded observer-cost validation; no numeric Product acceptance |
| P2 controlled capture (active, unconsumed) | Separate P2 AUTH remains unconsumed and bound to the designated Simulator. After P1 implementation and exact installed-payload verification, bind source/review, App/Extension hashes, Simulator/OS, schema/access/host/diagnostics state, Run ID and archive; consume before boot/install/arming/input | Bounded synthetic cold/warm capture, exact build/environment/journal hashes, query count and facade-duration distributions, censoring analysis and independent Quality handoff |

Stop on `UNKNOWN` required responsibility for the current stage, source/plan drift, inability to distinguish an empty result from unavailable sidecar, any sensitive input/candidate/host logging, synchronous hot-path persistence, wrong device, missing installed-payload identity, Human round exhaustion, or scope expansion to budget change, Gate, release or parent Close. Record a bounded limitation rather than a guessed performance conclusion.

**Handoff target:** Architecture & Knowledge Steward for the independent P1 field review; then the Input Intelligence Maintainer for implementation. Independent Test / Release reviews measurement evidence, and the Human Product Owner / Product Lead retains Product decisions. The original query-density Product residual remains open.
